# Runge Kutta neural network implementation
Small implementation of a Runge Kutta Neural Network. This neural network learns the behaviour of dynamical systems and its inner differential equations. This way it can make predictions in time but also describe intrinsic behaviour of the dynamics, such as attractors.

## Libraries (Python 3.5):
  - TensorFlow (<1.4): To train neural networks
  - Scikit-learn : To split data into train and test sets
  - Matplotlib : For plotting purposes
  
## Main files:
  - main.py: Script to run small demo
  - RungeKuttaNN.py: Contains neural network class
  - helper.py: Contains helper functions for the neural network

## How to run:
Run ```python main.py```.
